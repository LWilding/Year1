## 0. Practicals and Exercises

Includes code from the programs tasks on my beckett. I think all of the ones I've completely work properly.

## 1. Task 1: 

It starts with a loop that goes until 4 pizza prices are correctly inputted. It then stores these in our previously defined prices list.
Then using min and sum it identifies the cheapest pizza and the total from the list, which then is used to display the total and percentage of discount*

## 2. Task 2: The Storms of 2023/24
This task is fully completed. I received help in developing this code from Kyle.

## 3. Task 3: Managing Passwords

Have not attempted this task but will over summer.
